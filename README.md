This package downloads the official [demo](https://archive.org/details/HeroesofMightandMagicIITheSuccessionWars_1020). This can be installed at the first start. However, this contains only one scenario, no campaign and only limited assets.

It is therefore strongly recommended to extract the files from a purchased version. [Heroes II on GOG](https://www.gog.com/de/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition).

The easiest way is the installation via the GOG version. Just download the EXE file and select it.

Alternatively, the files can also be installed manually. In this case you need to copy (no symlink) the 'ANIM', 'DATA', 'MAPS' and 'MUSIC' folders from Heroes II to the fheroes2 folder.

For example:
- ~/.var/app/io.github.ihhub.Fheroes2/data/fheroes2/ANIM
- ~/.var/app/io.github.ihhub.Fheroes2/data/fheroes2/DATA
- ~/.var/app/io.github.ihhub.Fheroes2/data/fheroes2/MAPS
- ~/.var/app/io.github.ihhub.Fheroes2/data/fheroes2/MUSIC
