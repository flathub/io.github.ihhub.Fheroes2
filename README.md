This package downloads the official [demo](https://archive.org/details/HeroesofMightandMagicIITheSuccessionWars_1020). This can be installed at the first start. However, this contains only one scenario, no campaign and only limited assets.

It is therefore strongly recommended to extract the files from a purchased version. [Heroes II on GOG](https://www.gog.com/de/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition).

The easiest way is the installation via the GOG version. Just download the EXE file and select it.

For other installation methods see: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md)
